  🍵 Kombucha.js
=============
**Kombucha.js** is the easiest and the most robust all-in-one backend API development framework ... well, at least we believe so😉.

It includes JWT like encryption scheme for authentication so that it can serve API as you want with a trivial setup.

It also includes input/output validation which is powered by `runtime-typesafety` with `vanilla-schima-validattor`; you can find missing and wrong typed field values in your JSON requests right after you did something wrong.

  🐶 Features
=============
- Built-in JWT like authentication scheme
- Runtime typecheck not compile-time typecheck like TypeScript
- SQL without object mapping
