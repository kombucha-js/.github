üçµ Kombucha.js 
==================
**Kombucha.js** is (at least we believe) the easiest, the most robust, zero
dependent, and opinionated all-in-one frontend/backend application framework.


 ‚õ©Ô∏è Design Goalüóº 
==================
The design goal of **Kombusha.js** is to implement a reliable development
environment without TypeScript and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and make the
development process simple enough so that Vim in terminal-emulators without
VSCode or such funcy editors is sufficient to develop large-scale systems as if
it were AS/400.


  üê∂ Features
=============
- Zero dependent framework
- It runs out of the box
- Built-in JWT like authentication scheme
- Built-in runtime typecheck/schema validator
- NO ORM based programming SQL without object mapping

In backend development, you can scalably design web API as if they are simple
Node.js's module functions. In frontend development, you can access these API
as if they are simple module functions deployed as simpe ESM module.

It includes a unique frontend application framework called [react-rerenderers][]
which frees developpers from nasty Infinite Rendering Loops, devilish Prop
Drilling Hell, diabolical Provider Hell and other evil state.

In frontend application, you can access to the backend API server as if they
are only functions on the modules deployed in the frontend; this will
drastically reduce pain from frontend development.

It consists many new ideas to accomplish efficiency of development; such as
[runtime-typesafety][] which implements input/output validation on runtime, or as
[vanilla-schima-validator][] which allows you to find missing and wrong typed
field values in your JSON requests right after you did something wrong.

**Kombucha.js** is zero-dependent framework; that is, all modules in
**Kombucha.js** are developped by developpers of **Kombucha.js** its own. Each
of them is able to be used as an independend module.

  Thankspedia
===============
**Kombucha.js** is developped as a part of a project called [Thankspedia][].
[Thankspedia][] is a project to implement the infrastracture for thankfulness,
not for money; it, at least, tries to transfer an amount of money but an amount
of thankfulness. For further information about [Thankspedia][], please refer the
[webssite][Thankspedia].
