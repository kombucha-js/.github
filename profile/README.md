  🍵 Kombucha.js
=============
**Kombucha.js** is the easiest,the most robust, strongly opinionated,
all-in-one frontend/backend API development framework.

... Well, at least, we believe so😉.

Most functions that are usually necessary in frontend/backend development are
already included. It can serve API as you want with a trivial setup.

For example, it includes a unique frontend framework which is built upon
React.js. It also includes  JWT like encryption scheme for authentication.

In frontend application, you can access to the backend API server as if they
are functions on the modules placed in the frontend; this will drastically
reduce pain of frontend development.

It also includes input/output validation which is powered by
`runtime-typesafety` with `vanilla-schima-validattor`; you can find missing and
wrong typed field values in your JSON requests right after you did something
wrong.

  🐶 Features
=============
- Zero dependency
- Built-in JWT like authentication scheme
- Runtime typecheck not compile-time typecheck like TypeScript
- SQL without object mapping
